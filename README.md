# COMP1602-2021

This repository contains Computer Programming II lab material for Semester 3, 2020-2021 at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine. Note that this repository was created for code sharing convenience, and all solutions may be redacted at the end of the academic year in 2021.

## Week 1

Introduction to Structs in C++. Functions involving the use of structs as well as nested structs are covered. Note that the code you come up with for the `getDiffInYears` and `compareDate` functions may differ and still be completely correct.
